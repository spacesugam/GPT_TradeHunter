pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow
Prepare your data:

Create a CSV file containing historical price data for BankNifty. The file should have two columns: 'Date' and 'Close', where 'Date' represents the date of the price data and 'Close' represents the closing price of BankNifty.
Make sure the CSV file is located in the same directory as the Python script.
Open the Python script (banknifty_prediction.py) and modify the following variables if needed:

csv_file: Specify the filename of your CSV file containing the historical data.
Run the script by executing the following command:


python banknifty_prediction.py
The predicted prices for the next week will be displayed in the console and saved in a DataFrame.

You can access the predicted prices by examining the DataFrame or further process them as per your requirements.
